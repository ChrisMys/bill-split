Final project source code for COMP1073 Client-side JavaScript

We will be creating an application that will allow you to upload a bill/invoice and select from a group of users to then split the bill/invoice. We will provide an interface where you can put users into categories for easy selection and will allow you to split the bill between all the members of a category. There will also be a simple static bill splitter with a tip generator for ease of use when youâ€™re out at a restaurant with friends!
